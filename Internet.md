## Introduction to the Internet

**Network** — A group of computers or other devices connected to each other.

**Example:** Computers, phones, and other devices can connect together through the internet to share information or play games.

> The internet is a **network of networks**.

The internet was **developed in the late 1960s** by the United States Department of Defense.  
It was designed as a **decentralized communication network** that could withstand a nuclear attack.

## How the Internet Works: An Overview

At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols.

These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected **routers**, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems.



```
[Your Device]
      |
      |  sends data (packets)
      v
+-------------+
|   Router 1  |
+-------------+
      |
      |  forwards packet
      v
+-------------+
|   Router 2  |
+-------------+
      |
      |  forwards packet
      v
+-------------+
|   Router 3  |
+-------------+
      |
      |  continues until destination
      v
[Destination Device / Server]
```

- Your device breaks data into **packets**.
- Each router examines the **packet header** and decides the next hop.
- The packet travels router by router until it reaches the final destination.
- This process is repeated for every packet, which is why the internet is often called a **network of networks**.

## What is the Switch and why we need it?

There are PC 1, PC 2, PC 3 and so on until PC 7.

Note: PC is Personal Computer.

How do we connect all the PCs together?

Use switch and cables connect together with PCs

CAT-5 CAT-6

CAT = Category

Of course CAT-6 is faster

Fiber optic cable is faster than copper cables

Switch cannot use wireless technology, it only works with cables.

Can also use access point device instead of a switch device.

Access point device use wireless

We generally use copper cables.

All these computer can only communicate to each eather if they are in the same network.

Local Area Network or LAN
